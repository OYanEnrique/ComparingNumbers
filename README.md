# ComparingNumbers
A basic Python script that takes two numbers as input and compares them to determine which is greater or if they are equal.

# ↔️ Number Comparison Tool

This is a simple command-line program written in Python that compares two integer numbers provided by the user.

The script prompts the user to enter two numbers. It then evaluates them and prints a clear message stating which number is greater, or if the two numbers are equal.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `ComparingNumbers.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the script:
    ```sh
    python ComparingNumbers.py
    ```
5.  Enter the first number when prompted, then press Enter.
6.  Enter the second number and press Enter to see the comparison result.

## Logic

The program's logic is based on a simple `if/elif/else` structure that uses comparison operators:

* It first checks if the `first_number` is greater than (`>`) the `second_number`.
* If not, it then checks if the numbers are equal (`==`).
* If neither of the above conditions is true, it concludes that the `second_number` must be greater than the `first_number`.
